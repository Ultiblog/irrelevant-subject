content: "First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually
  stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good
  movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do
  not make a good movie. Let's start with the picture. As I said before, the
  special effects and computer animation are really good; the textures feel very
  real, and the degrees of liberty that CGI animation allows in terms of camera
  angles and movement is well used for dramatic effects. The luxurious
  vegetation of the forest and the CGI-animated wild animals are a treat to the
  eyes. In terms of artwork, there is a definite influence from Nausicaa (the
  forest-world, the spores) and Starcraft (the vessels, the goliaths). I saw the
  movie in an IMAX movie with 3D glasses, but I am not convinced that they used
  the full potential of it - quite honestly, the Haribo commercial before the
  movie made a better use of it. I find it more strenuous to watch a movie with
  the 3D-glasses - some details are blurry, and it feels likewise when the
  camera makes swift lateral movements. Now, the scenario - the movie
  disappoints in that area. The plot is very Manichean, and it feels like a
  remake of Pocahontas, interspersed with elements from / tributes to Star Wars
  (Pandora and the Na'vi look like Endor and the Ewoks respectively), Nausicaa
  (the forest as an entity, the destructive impact of civilization on nature,
  the spores in the forest), Starcraft (Colonel Quarritch and Dr Augustine bear
  some resemblance with Arcturus Mensk and Sarah Kerrigan), Matrix (the concept
  of controlling another image of self), and maybe even Independence Day (the
  pilot fighter suicide) and the Lion King (the father's death, 'go, and never
  come back!', ... am I going to far here?). But I can honestly say that I
  haven't been surprised at any point in the movie. You know from the beginning
  that he will be accepted by the Na'vi, that he will fall in love, that he will
  defect, that he will ultimately prevail after suffering some heavy casualties,
  and that he will find a way to permanently transfer his mind into the body of
  his avatar. It would have been interesting if the movie had dealt in more
  depth with the issues related to transferring one's mind into another body for
  instance, maybe a la Twelve Monkeys Army, where the 'hero' is clearly deeply
  affected by experiences that the mind is not used to deal with (time travel in
  that case, but it is not that different from what we have here). Likewise, the
  love interest of our hero seems very indifferent to the fact that he really is
  a human remotely controlling a human - Na'vi bastard. I was expecting someone
  (him, her, or even one of the other humans in the scientific group) to show at
  least some kind of surprise / doubt when these feelings emerge. I was
  expecting more complexity in the social interactions of the characters, and
  their personality. I also take issues with some big stereotypes: corporations
  and the white men are greedy, indigenous people are pure, brave, and connected
  to the earth, but dumb - thankfully there is a human to teach them how to
  fight those who come from the sky. To some extent, the movie feels like a
  remake of the colonization of the Americas; just replace the Na'vis by native
  Americans, the aircrafts by ships, and modern weapons by muskets, and you have
  it. Except of course the colonization of the Americas did not have such a
  happy ending for the native tribes. On the whole, the movie is beautiful, but
  it feels like the main goal was to showcase fancy special effects. The movie
  would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less linear and
  predictable plot."
